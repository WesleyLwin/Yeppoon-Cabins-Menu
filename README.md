# Yeppoon-Cabins-Menu
A beginner Java console application for managing cabin bookings, calculating charges, and displaying booking statistics — built for Yeppoon Cabins as part of my first university project.

# 🏕️ Yeppoon Cabins Booking System

This was my very first programming project during university. It’s a Java-based console application that allows users to manage cabin bookings, calculate accommodation charges, and generate simple booking statistics.
